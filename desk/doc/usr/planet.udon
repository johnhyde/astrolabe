# Planets

There are about 4.3 billion potential planets, so while they are not unlimited, they are
widely accessible for the average user. Most people pilot a planet or a moon when using Urbit.
As planets are the lowest rank of Azimuth point, they cannot spawn other points. Like galaxies
and stars, however, they can create [moons](/~/scry/docs/usr/astrolabe/moon.html).
