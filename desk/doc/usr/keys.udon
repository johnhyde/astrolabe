# Networking Keys

Each Urbit ship proves its identity on the network by signing its messages
with a pair of networking keys. By signing a message with a private key,
you prove that you are the owner of the associated public key.

Since public keys are stored in [Azimuth](/~/scry/docs/usr/astrolabe/azimuth.html),
other ships can verify your identity by checking your signatures.

## Keyfile

A keyfile is just a file containing your networking keys. It is used when
booting Arvo (Urbit's OS) for the first time, and the information within
is baked into the resulting ship. After this, the keyfile should be deleted
to prevent accidentally double-booting in the future.

## Changing Keys

If your private key is compromised, you can change your keys in Bridge and
update your ship by running `|rekey 'new-private-key-goes-here'` in Dojo (the terminal).
This will increase your `life` number in Azimuth, which is just a record of how many
times your keys have been revised. This number will also be incremented if you
set new keys in the course of performing a factory reset.

Since keys must be set before a ship can be booted,
all active Urbit IDs will have a `life` of at least 1.

# Performing a Factory Reset (a.k.a. Breaching)

When using the network, ships keep track of the order of all the messages they've sent
and received, and use this to ensure that they process messages properly.
This is called continuity.

Performing a factory reset means breaking continuityâ€”asking the rest of the network
to forget your past messages and treat you like a new ship. It also involves clearing
your own event log, and consequently all apps and data on the ship.
Sometimes this is done to resolve networking errors, like those caused by double-booting.
This is also appropriate when transferring an ID to someone else, to give them a fresh start.

Because factory resets involve booting a fresh ship, you'll need to rejoin groups,
reinstall apps, and generally start from scratch. Trying to continue using your old pier
(the folder containing your data) will just cause more networking issues.
There are, however, a few unofficial tools with which you can restore some data from
a previous pier, and more will likely be built over time.

If you want to avoid breaching, avoid double-booting and don't delete your pier.
If you want to move your pier (e.g. to host your ship on a remote server), it is
crucial that you shut down your ship before you start it somewhere else.
If you have two different instances of the same ship trying to run at the same time,
other ships will get confused and you will need to breach to communicate with them properly.
Deleting your pier, or using an outdated archive of your pier will have the same effect.

Breaching, or performing a factory reset, will increment your `rift` number in Azimuth,
so this number is an indicator of how many times a ship has breached.
Ships which have never breached have a `rift` of 0.
