# Stars

Stars are scarce and valuableâ€”a natural fit for businesses, communities, or other organizations.
The maximum supply of stars is 65,280.

Each star can spawn 65,535 [planets](/~/scry/docs/usr/astrolabe/planet.html), and provides network routing, software updates,
and other services for the planets it sponsors.
Stars can also choose to de-sponsor planets which abuse the network.

Stars are NFTs, but they can be exchanged 1:1 for WSTR at [star.market](https://star.market/),
and you can trade fractional amounts of WSTR for ETH [on Uniswap V3](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x7f4a0822a6e3c085df795a8d78acbcd36f210ebf).

## Locked stars and the Linear Release Contract

To prevent galaxies from spawning too many stars all at once, many galaxies' stars were locked
in an Ethereum contract, to be slowly released (at a linear rate) over time.
Stars which are locked in this way will show the contract address as their owner,
and any stars held by this contract are considered locked, even if they are ready to be released.
