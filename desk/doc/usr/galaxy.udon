# Galaxies

Galaxies are the rarest and highest ranking class of Urbit ID, as there are only 256 of them.
Together, they form the [Galactic Senate](https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/senate)
which has the power make changes to the Urbit ID system.
Galaxies help route communication on the network, and each one can spawn 255 [stars](/~/scry/docs/usr/astrolabe/star.html).

## @p

A galaxy `@p` is just one phoneme, 3 letters. E.g. `~zod`, `~bus`, and `~fes` are galaxies.

## Spawning

Each galaxy can spawn 255 stars.
These stars will have 2-phoneme `@p`s starting with a prefix, and ending with the galaxy's `@p`.
E.g. `~zod` spawned `~marzod`, `~binzod`, and `~wanzod`, among others.

## Sponsoring

A galaxy can sponsor stars and planets, although usually planets are sponsored by stars.
By default, a galaxy will sponsor all its children, although it can sponsor others as well.

Galaxies perform peer discovery for their sponsees, meaning that they tell other Urbit IDs
where they can find their sponsees so that they can communicate directly withthemâ€”similar to
asking a DNS server to tell you where to look for google.com.
Thus, it is crucially important that galaxies be online and reachable.

## The Galactic Senate

All galaxy owners are members of the [Galactic Senate](https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/senate).
Galaxy owners can [vote](https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/voting) on proposals
to upgrade the logic of [Azimuth](/~/scry/docs/usr/astrolabe/azimuth.html)
or approve the content of a document.
