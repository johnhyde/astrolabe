# Comets

Comets are essentially unlimited, and can be created for free by anyone.
They're good for new people exploring the network, operating somewhat anonymously,
and testing things out. However, the keys for a comet can't be changed, so it's not
not a viable long-term ID. Also, since anyone can boot a comet, comets might be viewed
with distrust in some contexts.
